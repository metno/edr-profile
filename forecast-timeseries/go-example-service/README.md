# OGC-API EDR Go service for profile forecast timeseries

## Bundle openapi
With redocly:

```bash
cd openapi
redocly bundle met-ts.yaml --output met-ts-bundle.yaml
```

## How service was created

- Boilerplate autogenerated code with https://github.com/deepmap/oapi-codegen
- Implemented server interface
- Static data responses

### Autogeneration

```bash
cd forecast-timeseries/go-example-service
mkdir forecastts
oapi-codegen -generate server -package forecastts ../openapi/met-ts-bundle.yaml > forecastts/forecastts.gen.go
```
