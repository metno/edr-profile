# OGC-API EDR Go service for profile forecast timeseries

## How the service was created

- Boilerplate autogenerated code with https://github.com/deepmap/oapi-codegen from profile openapi spec.
- Fill in a few gaps in the autogenerated code with some "glue" code.
- Implemented server interface from autogenerated code.
- Static data responses.

### Autogeneration

```bash
cd metocean-timeseries/go-example-service
mkdir metoceants
oapi-codegen -generate types,server -package metoceants openapi/metocean-ts-bundle.yaml > metoceants/metoceants.gen.go
```

## How to use

1. Install Go.

2. Start the service:

```bash
cd go-example-service
go run .
```

3. Go to `localhost:1323` in your browser.
